## DynamicLetter Code Kata

This is the solution to a code kata of my own.
I created this code kata as it will serve the purpose of a bigger project.

## Instructions

Create a paragraph that self actualizes with one random character at a given speed (10 times per second)

## Why did I do it as a Code Kata and why is it public ?

**why a code kata**

- The bigger project I have is an **animation template** on text that makes letters come **one by one** to the screen with random character apparition prior to the character that is actually part of the text. It's an animation you often see in movies, which you can easily do using After Effects, but this time, **no video format**.

- This **Dynamic Letter Animation** is basically one sub-problem of the animation I'm trying to create. I could not possibly do that whole animation in one step as it requires a triple async recursive function.

**why is it public**

- I'm now trying to put "Learn In Public" in practice, which I've heard for the first time on **codewars** :
